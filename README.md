# Minifier & Compressor for PPL Code
Minification of your code results in it taking up less space, making it use less storage of your HP Prime's storage memory giving you more space for more programs.

> [!NOTE]
The PPL file must be in UTF-16LE format, and at this time, .hpprgrm files with header and footer are not supportedâ€”only raw code is accepted currently.

>[!WARNING]
Future updates will no longer be uploaded to this GitHub repository. Instead, all future updates will be available at the <a href="https://github.com/Insoft-UK/PrimeSDK">PrimeSDK</a> repository.
