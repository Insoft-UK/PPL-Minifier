# PPL Minifier

Currently in the early experimental and testing phase, the primary goal is to minimize the file size of any PPL code, reducing its overall footprint. The PPL file must be in UTF-16LE format, and at this time, .hpprgrm files with headers are not supportedâ€”only raw code is accepted.
